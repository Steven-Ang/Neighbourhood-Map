# Neighbourhood Map

A single page application features a map of San Francisco showing the famous tourist attractions via markers. Additional information about the location will be displayed when the marker is clicked. By default, a list of the locations will be visible in the sidebar, click any one of them will make the info window appear. The search bar is provided to filter out the place.

# API

* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) is used to display the map, marker, and info windows into the web application.
* [FourSquare API](https://foursquare.com/) is used to add additional information about the location onto the info windows.
